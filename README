NAME
    Term::Title - Portable API to set the terminal titlebar

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.03.

SYNOPSIS
         use Term::Title 'set_titlebar';
     
     set_titlebar("This goes into the title");
     
     set_titlebar("Title", "And also print this to the terminal");

DESCRIPTION
    Term::Title provides an abstraction for setting the titlebar (or title
    tab) across different types of terminals. For *nix terminals, it prints
    the appropriate escape sequences to set the terminal title based on the
    value of $ENV{TERM}. On Windows, it uses Win32::Console to set the title
    directly.

    Currently, supported terminals include:

    *   xterm

    *   rxvt

    *   screen

    *   Win32 console

USAGE
  "set_titlebar()"
         set_titlebar( $title, @optional_text );

    Sets the titlebar to $title or clears the titlebar if $title is
    undefined.

    On terminals that require printing escape codes to the terminal, a
    newline character is also printed to the terminal. If @optional_text is
    given, it will be printed to the terminal prior to the newline. Thus, to
    keep terminal output cleaner, use "set_titlebar()" in place of a
    "print()" statement to set the titlebar and print at the same time.

    If the terminal is not supported, set_titlebar silently continues,
    printing @optional_text if any.
